## Introduction
This tutorial will teach you how to manage schemas with Schema Registry. This will enable us to ensure a consistent exchange of data across distributed systems, thus minimizing any errors.

## Background context
To handle the evolving complexity of modern Event-Driven Architecture, the need for schema management has become increasingly prevalent. Data validation is a technique that helps in maintaining data consistency and compatibility. Schema Registry can be used to validate data being exchanged by producers and consumers. 

In this tutorial, weâ€™ve used the Apicurio Registry, which is a popular Schema Registry implementation, in combination with Avro which is a language-neutral data serialization system.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin with this tutorial, it is already assumed that you already have:
- Set up an instance of Apicurio Registry 
- Created an AsyncAPI document 
- Some knowledge of Avro serialization
